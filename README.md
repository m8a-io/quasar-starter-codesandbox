# Quasar App

Welcome to the Quasar Codesandbox template (interim solution). You can do everything in the dev environment of the Quasar CLI, just not run CLI commands. With this environment though, you can share more in-depth code involving Vuex, Vue-router and other app extensions too. Think of it like an advanced JSFiddle or Codepen scenario, but with more bells and whistles from Vue and Quasar. 

**Tip!!**
If you need to run in SSR or PWA dev mode, change the "scripts/start" entry in package.json to 

`quasar dev -m ssr`

or 

`quasar dev -m pwa`

respectively and restart the container. 

**Known Issues: Single Quotes changing to Double Quotes**
If you notice single quotes being automatically changed to double quotes, you need to change your Codesandbox preferences. Click on your avatar top right and click on "Preferences". The preferences dialog will open. Click on "Prettier Settings" and turn "Use Single Quotes" to true. 

If you have any futher issues, please contact smolinari on the Quasar Discord Channel or the Quasar forum.
